## Description
In this project, I have demonstrated the usage of Ansible and Vagrant together to create (Vagrant) and configure (Ansible) a Virtual Machine in Virtual Box.  

## Usage  
Following command will create the virtual machines and configure them with the existing Ansible roles. 
`vagrant up`  

In order to SSH to virtual machine:    
`vagrant ssh <vm-name>`  
exp: vagrant ssh node1
